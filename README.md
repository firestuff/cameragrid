cameragrid
==========

Axis multiple camera feed display.

You can use this script directly from github/rawgithub. Create a URL like:

https://rawgit.com/flamingcowtv/cameragrid/master/cameragrid.html#http://127.0.0.1/,http://127.0.0.5:2005/

Substitute your own Axis camera URLs for the URLs after the #, and separate them with commas.

There are some keyboard shortcuts:
* 1-9:     select a camera
* <esc>:   back to grid
* s:       scan through cameras
* <space>: pause scan
